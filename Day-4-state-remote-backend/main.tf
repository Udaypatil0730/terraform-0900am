#Note:When multiple developers work on the same Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate), several problems can arise. These issues can cause conflicts, resource corruption, and deployment failures.
#Merge Conflicts in terraform.tfstate
#If a developer runs terraform plan on an outdated state file, and another applies changes, the state will be out of sync.


#solution is below 
# need to implement state locking provision by using DynamoDB process
