ðŸ“Œ Terraform Interview Prep â€“ Summary
ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts & Keywords

Terraform Basics: IaC, declarative, immutable infra, plan â†’ apply cycle.

State Management: terraform.tfstate, remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB lock / Terraform Cloud).

Workspaces: Isolate dev/qa/prod environments.

Modules: Reusable code for VPC, EKS, RDS, Security.

Variables & Locals: DRY code, environment-specific tfvars.

Data Sources: Fetch latest AMI, existing VPC IDs, etc.

Count / For_each: Scaling resources dynamically (multi-env, multi-instances).

Depends_on: Control resource creation order.

Provisioners: Remote-exec / local-exec (though discouraged for prod).

Terraform Import: Bring manually created AWS resources into Terraform.

Terraform Cloud / Sentinel: Remote state, compliance, policy enforcement.

Upgrade Scenarios: Change instance_type in .tfvars, apply â†’ Terraform recreates/upgrades resource.

State Drift Handling: terraform plan -refresh-only, align actual infra with state.

CI/CD Integration: Terraform in Jenkins pipeline (PR approval â†’ plan â†’ apply).

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Scenarios / Stories
Sanofi (Pharma â€“ Cloud Ops Engineer)

Provisioned VPC, EC2, RDS with Terraform.

Used S3 + DynamoDB for remote state & locking.

Automated tagging via for_each.

Fetched latest AMI with data sources.

Upgraded EC2 (t2.micro â†’ t2.medium) by changing instance_type.

Solved state lock conflicts via DynamoDB locking.

ABN AMRO Clearing Bank (DevOps Engineer)

Managed EKS cluster, Node groups, Helm releases via Terraform.

Repo structured as mono-repo with modules.

Used Terraform Cloud Enterprise backend with Sentinel policies.

Implemented count & for_each for multiple envs (UAT, Pre-Prod).

Migrated manual RDS via terraform import.

Implemented depends_on for sequencing infra build.

Zero-downtime upgrade â†’ blue/green node groups in EKS.

Solved state drift using refresh-only.

CI/CD: Jenkins pipeline â†’ Terraform Plan â†’ Approval â†’ Apply.

ðŸ”¹ Interview Q&A (Based on Our Chat)

Q1. How do you manage Terraform state in your projects?
ðŸ‘‰ Used S3 + DynamoDB for state & locking (Sanofi), Terraform Cloud for remote state & Sentinel policies (ABN AMRO).

Q2. What if two engineers apply Terraform at the same time?
ðŸ‘‰ DynamoDB lock prevents concurrency; also enforced GitOps process with PR approval before apply.

Q3. How do you upgrade an EC2 instance type using Terraform?
ðŸ‘‰ Change instance_type in variables, run plan â†’ apply. Terraform either recreates or resizes depending on resource.

Q4. Where did you use data sources?
ðŸ‘‰ To fetch the latest AMI from SSM, and to fetch existing VPC IDs during migrations.

Q5. Where did you use count or for_each?
ðŸ‘‰ for_each â†’ tagging all resources with env/project/owner.
ðŸ‘‰ count â†’ spinning up multiple identical EC2 instances or multiple envs (UAT/Pre-Prod).

Q6. Where did you use depends_on?
ðŸ‘‰ Ensured RDS created before app servers; in EKS, ensured VPC & subnets existed before cluster provisioning.

Q7. Did you face Terraform state drift? How did you handle it?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, when someone changed infra via AWS console. I used terraform plan -refresh-only to align state.

Q8. Did you ever import resources into Terraform?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, migrated existing RDS into Terraform using terraform import.

Q9. How did you integrate Terraform with CI/CD?
ðŸ‘‰ In ABN AMRO, Jenkins pipeline â†’ Terraform plan runs â†’ manual approval â†’ apply to production.

Q10. How do you enforce compliance in Terraform?
ðŸ‘‰ Used Sentinel policies in Terraform Cloud (e.g., no unencrypted S3, mandatory tagging).
